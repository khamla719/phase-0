What does puts do?
  - puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line

What is an integer? What is a float?
  - an integer is any whole number and a float is a number with decimal points.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  - When you using division with integers, the output will round down a whole number, whereas with floats, the output will be the exact answer with decimals. If you wanted to see how many $2 hotdogs you could buy for $5, the answer would be 2, not 2.5. If you wanted to know an exact calculation, you would use floats.

```ruby
puts 24 * 365
puts 60 * 8760 * 10
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
  - Ruby handles basic math in the same way that it looks. The '+' is for addition, '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, '/' for division.

What is the difference between integers and floats?
  - integers are whole numbers and floats are exact numbers that include a decimal point.

What is the difference between integer and float division?
  - the quotient for integer division will return a whole number rounded down. For floats, the quotient is returned with the exact value including decimal point.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
  - strings are a group of letters, punctuation, and digits. You would use them to convey the output that you want to see.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
  - local variables begin with lower case letter or underscore and do not have the value nil before initialization. They are used to store information.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
  - This was a great reminder of what i thought I previously forgot.
