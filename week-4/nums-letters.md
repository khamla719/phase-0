What does puts do?
  - puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line

What is an integer? What is a float?
  - an integer is any whole number and a float is a number with decimal points.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  - When you using division with integers, the output will round down a whole number, whereas with floats, the output will be the exact answer with decimals. If you wanted to see how many $2 hotdogs you could buy for $5, the answer would be 2, not 2.5. If you wanted to know an exact calculation, you would use floats.

```ruby
puts 24 * 365
puts 60 * 8760 * 10
```
