What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?
  - they are Track Changes, Make Changes, and Push Changes. When changes have been made to a project, you must add those changes to be staged for commit using "git add". Once changes have been added, you can officially commit the changes using "git commit". The branch, with changes now committed, can be pushed to GitHub using "git push origin branchname".
