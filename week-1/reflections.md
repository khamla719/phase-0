# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

In this section, I learned about many methods for managing time and productivity. I found that each method was helpful to me in different ways. The Pomodoro technique taught me the benefits of having a set amount of time to do work, taking breaks, and tracking the increments of how much time a certain project takes. The Fogg method was very interesting in showing that creating tiny habits on the back of your current behaviors is a manageable way to achieve a big goal. Time-boxing is setting aside a specified amount of time to commit to work and then stopping at the end of the time regardless of the amount of progress. The ultimate goal is to review what was accomplished during the given time. I believe that this will be very useful during peer-pairing projects. By gauging how much work was completed in a given amount of time, we improve personal and peer time management.

I believe my current methods of time management are poor and consist only of my smartphone calendar and reminders list. I don’t believe that it is working for me because I often fall behind on tasks that I have planned or scheduled. I definitely plan on implementing the Pomodoro technique by taking regular breaks and tracking how much work I accomplished in each segment. I would like to implement Fogg’s method by doing 1 brief exercise from “Learning Ruby the Hard Way” after I shower in the morning. I hope to create a habit that allows me to get better at code by practicing small increments every day.

My overall plan for phase 0 time management is to begin every Monday with reviewing the entire module for the week and specify certain hours for doing each segment of work. I will take breaks every 25 minutes with meditation or any activity other than work and set a timer to go back to work. I will then track if I was able to complete each segment with the given amount of time and adjust the time accordingly for the next week.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell or bash is a command line interface that allows users to manage and investigate files and directories. Due to the practice-oriented guide, I found the material to be quite easy and very straightforward. The only challenge that comes to mind would be putting these commands to use in more complex situations. I was able to successfully use all of the commands with the exception of xargs, sudo, chmod, chown. In my opinion, the most important commands to know would be "man" and "apropos". These two commands can help you figure out how commands work.

-pwd print working directory

-ls list directory

-mv move file or dir

-cd change dir

-../ move up in dir

-touch create blank file

-mkdir create directory

-less page through a file

-rmdir remove directory

-rm remove file

-help manual for commands
