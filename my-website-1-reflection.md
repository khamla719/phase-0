Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  - from your GitHub homepage, click the "+" icon near the top right-hand corner. 
  - click "New Repository"
  - enter the name, a description, security and licensing, then click "create repository"
  - Once in your new repository, click "Clone in Desktop" on the bottom right hand corner and save the file.

Describe what open source means.
  - open source means the source code for a program is available to anyone for review and modification. There are different types of licensing options for open source, but the basis is that everyone can see the code.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  - I think open source is a positive idea. By allowing everyone to have access to source codes, we open the gates for innovation on a scale that may not be as significant on a proprietary level. That being said, I can understand the financial reasons that someone would want to keep their code protected.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
  - licensing is a great way to keep your source code open for modification and improvement, meanwhile ensuring that you receive credit as the creator.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  - this challenge definitely solidified my skills in making changes to code. I felt more comfortable with starting changes all the way to merging. The licensing information definitely cleared up some questions, but I am still unsure of when one would use different licensing types. Overall, I don't feel that I have struggled with this challenge.
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  - I did not refer to any external resources because I felt comfortable with the challenge. As far as understanding the various licensing types, I feel that it would be more important once I have actually started writing projects of my own.
