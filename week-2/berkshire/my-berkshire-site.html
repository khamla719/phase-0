	<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  I thought the training did well in preparing for the actual site. It was interesting to work with another co-hort and to see the differences in approach taken.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  There were many resources given for HTML5 elements, but I stuck with the basics from codeacademy for this challenge. I plan on doing more research as my skills develop and the need for complex elements arises.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I think we did well with not worrying about the format for the text. Most of our time was spent with layout. We chose to use a table for the topic list in the website.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  The good thing about html is that it only deals with text. You don't have to worry much with methods and arguments like other programming languages. I have not found anything bad working with html.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I haven't really developed any tricks yet, besides the usual copy and paste. For reference, I have bookmarked many resources for coding in html.
