How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
  - The inspector allows you to see HTML and CSS code alongside with the page itself. Being able to see your changes happen in real time was extremely helpful.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
  - You can resize elements using the height and width properties.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
  - Static is the default positioning if there is no specific position defined. Absolute is positioning that is relative to the first parent element that does not have a static position. Relative is the positioning that tells the element where to go if it had a static positioning. Fixed positioning is "fixed" so no matter where you scroll or where it is placed, it will always be visible.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
  - Margin is the space between around the element. Border is the edge of the element. Padding is the space between the content and the border.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
  - I loved it! Learning about how to position and style elements makes me think of other possibilities. Every new challenge has increased my confidence.
