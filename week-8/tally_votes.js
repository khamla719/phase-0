// Reflection
/*
What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?

I learned that iterating over nested objects in JavaScript can be very confusing and hard to keep track
of which object you are iterating over. It was tough to manage so many different properties, but after a ton of
trial and error I feel more confident using the for...in iteration method which I had never used before.

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?

I did not find many other methods to use other then the .hasOwnProperty method which was included in the linked
stack overflow article in the directions.

What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?

Working through this challenge the concept of properly accessing elements within a nested hash was solidified.
Although I still find it a bit hard to manage and keep track of, I do feel more confident than I did going into
the challenge.
